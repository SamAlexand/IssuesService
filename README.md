# IssuesService
The beginnings of a sample REST service for a simplistic defect tracking application built with Node, Express, Mongoose and Mongo.

This is part of my presentation at 2015 IBM ConnectED conference entitled  "AD203: Building Digital Experiences in the Cloud with BlueMix and WebSphere Portal Tools."  It can run in a standalone development environment or it can be installed on IBM BlueMix via the Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface (CLI).

Running Locally:
Install Node
Install MongoDB
In the directory containing this code, type "npm install"
To run the app, type "node app"

Running on BlueMix:
Create Bluemix account
Create new Application (web). 
Select IBM SDK for Node.JS
Create new Service
Select MongoDB
Bind it to the application you created above.
Open the Dashboard for the application you created above
Select "Start Coding" from the left navigation
Use the simple steps on the Start Coding page to push the service to Bluemix

Note that this application is for demonstration purposes only and is not supported by my employer.

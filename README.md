# IssuesService
The beginnings of a sample REST service for a simplistic defect tracking application built with Node, Express, Mongoose and Mongo.

This is part of my presentation at 2015 IBM ConnectED conference entitled  "AD203: Building Digital Experiences in the Cloud with BlueMix and WebSphere Portal Tools."  It can run in a standalone development environment or it can be installed on IBM BlueMix via the Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface (CLI).
